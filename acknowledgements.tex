        First and foremost, I want to express my deep gratitude to my advisor Kathryn Hess for her constant support, encouragement and patience, with which she has inspired me, shaped my thinking and trained me in mathematical research.
        I'm also greatly indebted to Gijs Heuts, for acting as an unofficial co-supervisor, sharing his profound understandings and insights in homotopy theory. 

        I'm grateful to Hadrian Heine for explaining the results in his PhD thesis and many enlightening discussions along the writing of this thesis. I also want to thank Markus Hausmann, Jens Kjaer, Ben Knudsen, Lennart Meier, Beren Sanders and Jerome Scherer who had shared their knowledge and insights during my PhD.
        
        I want to thank my academic siblings at EPFL, Adelie, Aras, Celia, Kelly, Lyne, Olivia, Samuel and Stefania, for the joy and mathematical discussions along this journey.
        % Also, I appreciate the math discussions and countless lunches I had with the members at the UPHESS group; Anibal, Nicolas Berkouk, 
        % Daniela Santander, Jens Kjaer, Inbar Klang, Darrick Lee, Anibal Medina-Mardones, Nicolas Ninin, Raphael Reinauer, Nima Rasekh, Beren Sanders, Martina Scolamiero, Kürşat Sözer, Gard Spreemann and Guillaume Tauzin. 
        Special thanks go to Maroussia Schaffner for the support from the administrative side of my time at EPFL.
        
        I want to thank the Chinese homotopy theory community for the invitation to the conferences in Shenzhen and Shanghai;
        in particular to Danny Xiaolin Shi, Guozhen Wang, Zhouli Xu, and Yifei Zhu. 
        I would also like to thank Zhipeng Duan, Hana Jia Kong, Guchuan Li, Yuqing Shi, Yu Zhang, Mingcong Zeng and Foling Zou for the math discussions and online reading groups.
        
        My life in Switzerland wouldn't be so colorful without the accompany of my friends in Zurich and Lausanne. I'm indebted to my friends in Zurich, in particular to Chong, Junliang and Yukun, who had shared their advice and experience on doing research in math;
        I also appreciate the accompany of my friends in Lausanne; especially to Hao, Shengquan, Weizhe and Zhiwen, for all the joy and happiness we shared in the three common years we spent at EPFL.
        Special thanks go to Boris, Clara, Marika and Zheng for keeping my final year at EPFL not so lonely.
        
        Last but not the least, I want to thank my parents for their unconditional support and understanding of each of my decisions.
